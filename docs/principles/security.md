🛡️ Security in System Design

Security is the foundation of any reliable and trustworthy system.
It involves protecting data, services, and users from unauthorized access, misuse, and disruption — while ensuring that legitimate users can operate safely and efficiently.

In distributed systems, security is not a single layer — it’s a defense-in-depth strategy, integrated at every level of architecture.

⚙️ Why Security Matters

A system’s functionality, availability, and performance are meaningless if it cannot protect data or user trust.
Security breaches can lead to:

Data loss, corruption, or leakage

Unauthorized access or privilege escalation

Service downtime due to attacks

Reputational and financial damage

🧠 Principle: “Security is not a feature — it’s a design decision.”

🧩 Core Principles of Security (CIA Triad)
Principle	Description	Example
Confidentiality	Ensure only authorized users can access data	Encryption, access controls
Integrity	Ensure data is accurate and untampered	Checksums, hashing, digital signatures
Availability	Ensure systems remain accessible when needed	Redundancy, DDoS protection

These form the CIA triad, the foundation of information security.

🔑 Authentication and Authorization
Authentication (AuthN)

Verifies who the user or system is.

Passwords and MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect

Certificates, API tokens, service accounts

Authorization (AuthZ)

Determines what the user or system is allowed to do.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

Policy engines (e.g., Open Policy Agent, AWS IAM policies)

🔒 Data Security
At Rest

Encrypt data using AES-256 or stronger algorithms.

Use secure key management systems (KMS, Vault).

Avoid storing secrets in code or plain text.

In Transit

Enforce TLS (HTTPS, gRPC over TLS) for all communication.

Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for service-to-service authentication.

Apply HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) headers.

In Use

Employ secure enclaves (e.g., Intel SGX, AWS Nitro Enclaves).

Mask or anonymize sensitive data during processing.

🧱 Network Security
Layer	Controls
Edge Layer	Firewalls, WAF (Web Application Firewall), API gateways
Network Layer	VPC isolation, subnets, security groups, VPNs
Service Layer	mTLS, ingress/egress policies, service meshes (e.g., Istio)
Host Layer	OS patching, intrusion detection, anti-malware

💡 Use the zero-trust model — assume every request is untrusted until proven otherwise.

🧮 Application Security
Secure Coding Practices

Validate and sanitize all inputs (prevent SQLi, XSS).

Escape output data in templates and APIs.

Use parameterized queries and ORM layers.

Limit use of eval, dynamic queries, or unsafe deserialization.

Secret Management

Use secret managers (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

Rotate credentials regularly.

Avoid embedding credentials in container images or codebases.

Dependency Management

Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., Snyk, Trivy).

Keep libraries and frameworks updated.

Prefer official and signed packages.

🌐 API and Microservice Security

Use JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.

Apply rate limiting and request throttling to prevent abuse.

Validate request payloads with schemas (e.g., JSON Schema, OpenAPI).

Implement service-to-service authorization via mTLS or SPIFFE.

Apply least privilege principles to service accounts and API keys.

🔄 Infrastructure Security

Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) scanning (e.g., Terraform Compliance, Checkov).

Enforce network segmentation and least-privilege IAM policies.

Use immutable infrastructure (redeploy instead of patching in place).

Enable audit logging across infrastructure components.

Restrict shell access and use bastion hosts for controlled entry.

🧠 Observability and Incident Response
Monitoring

Log authentication and authorization events.

Detect anomalies and access patterns (SIEM tools like Splunk, ELK, Datadog).

Enable distributed tracing to detect lateral movement.

Alerting

Trigger alerts for suspicious login attempts, privilege escalations, and data exfiltration.

Integrate alerts with on-call systems (PagerDuty, Opsgenie).

Incident Response

Maintain a documented incident response plan.

Perform post-incident reviews (RCA).

Simulate attack scenarios (red/blue team exercises).

🧠 Security by Design Principles
Principle	Description
Least Privilege	Grant only necessary access
Defense in Depth	Layer multiple security controls
Fail Securely	Deny access by default, fail closed
Separation of Duties	Divide responsibilities to reduce insider risk
Auditability	Maintain traceability for all critical actions
Secure Defaults	Enable strong protections by default
💥 Common Threats and Mitigations
Threat	Description	Mitigation
SQL Injection	Malicious query injection	Parameterized queries
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)	Injecting malicious scripts	Output encoding, CSP headers
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)	Unauthorized request submission	CSRF tokens
DDoS Attacks	Overwhelming traffic	Rate limiting, load balancing, WAF
Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)	Intercepted communication	TLS, certificate pinning
Credential Stuffing	Reused passwords	MFA, password hashing, rate limits
🌍 Real-World Examples
System	Security Approach	Notes
Google BeyondCorp	Zero-trust architecture	No VPN, per-request authentication
AWS IAM	Fine-grained access control	Policy-based authorization
Netflix Security Monkey	Automated auditing	Detects security config drift
Kubernetes RBAC	Namespaced, least-privilege model	Integrated with service accounts
HashiCorp Vault	Centralized secret management	Dynamic secrets and encryption as a service
